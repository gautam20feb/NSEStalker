1. NAGARCONST,MUNDRAPORT -couldn't find the symbol
2. MySql doesn't detect special characters so I replaced "&" by "AND" and "-" by ""
3. In Tws if we have been requesting for a ticker and meanwhile the Internet got disconnected, TWS doesn't accept any other request till it serves the first one so the data got corrupted.
4. The per minute data for an year for each year has around 94,500 rows but some have relatively lower number of rows . Example- Bhushan Steel , Auropharma
