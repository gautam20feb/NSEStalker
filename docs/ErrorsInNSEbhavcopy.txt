1.The URLs for the earlier years like 2001 can be accessed using "01Jan2001" as well as "1Jan2001" but for the later years , only the first format works.

2. "hoiday.csv" is faulty.

3. Some days were declared holiday after the list of holidays had been published.

4.Some files have rows without spaces between them especially year 2002 , 2004,2006 ,2007
  Also the same files have empty rows.
  example: cm17OCT2002bhav.csv

5.The column name is mixed betwwn "OPTION_TYP" and "OPTIONTYPE".

6.Under "OPTION_TYP" many files have "FF" for the future.
   Initially I had seperated the "futures" from "fo" files using the "XX" under the "OPTION_TYP" but many files(34) had "FF" instead so had to use "STRIKE_PR"
